ICAIA takes plagiarism very seriously and regard plagiarism as a professional misconduct. Papers will be screened for plagiarism and when identified the paper will be rejected. In addition, all authors of the paper will be denied to the conference and other papers by these author(s) will also be rejected. When paper accepted, ICAIA don't encourage withdrawals after the paper is being accepted, meaning it should not be submitted with the intention to get the reviews by the TPC.</p>
